    <li><p><h3>Step Four</h3></p><p>Add a large spoonful of egg white to the cake mix, beat together to loosen the mixture,</p>
    <p>then gently fold through the remaining egg whites with a large metal spoon, until you have a smooth batter.</p></li>
    <li><p><h3>Step Five</h3></p><p>Pour into the tin, smooth the top and bake for 40-45 mins until a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean.</p>
    <p>Mix together the evaporated milk, condensed milk and 3 tbsp of the cream.</p></li>
    <li><p><h3>Step Six</h3></p><p>Leave the cake to cool for 10 mins in the tin, then ease a knife around the sides. Poke holes over the surface with a skewer, then pour over half the milk mixture.</p></li>
